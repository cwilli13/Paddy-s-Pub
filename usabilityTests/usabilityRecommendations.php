            <li>The hours of operation are not prominently displayed
                <p>
                We changed the minutes until Paddy's closes so it displays the closing time. We also added a link that triggers an alert window with the bar hours.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>The "about us" page should have more info that just the bar owners.
                <p>We added the bar hours to the "about us" page, and we also added contact information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Menu prices are unclear with price additions, such as when adding chili to burgers.
                <p>We changed the prices to be more clear by aligning the price additions to the right.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The home page should have links to the about us page
                <p>We added a link</p>
